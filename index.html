    <h1>Welcome to my interactive resume!</h1>
    
    <div class="block-div">
      <p>From the moment I first laid hands on a computer, I knew that programming was my true calling, my destined path
        to greatness. The endless possibilities of this machine captivated me, and I found myself exploring every inch
        of its power. Programming has always been my passion, the key to unlocking the full potential of this remarkable
        invention and bending it to my will.</p>

      <p>Growing up was tough, especially after the loss of our father at such a young age. I had to step up and take on
        the responsibility of providing for my family and supporting our household. For years, I dedicated myself to
        mastering the skills required to succeed in business, studying everything from foreign trade and sales to
        marketing, hydraulics, and mechanics. I became a specialized technician, traveling the world to take technical
        courses in different factories.</p>

      <p>But deep down, I always knew that there was something more waiting for me, a higher purpose that I was destined
        to fulfill. And it wasn't until I became a husband and father myself that I realized what that purpose truly
        was. I want to be a programmer, a creator of worlds, a master of technology. The future is mine for the taking,
        and I am ready to seize it with all the passion and determination that has driven me from the very beginning.
        Welcome to my world, where the possibilities are endless and the only limits are those we set for ourselves.</p>

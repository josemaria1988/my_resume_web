      <h1>Welcome to my interactive resume!</h1>

      <div class="block-div">
        <p class="p-index">From the moment I first laid hands on a computer, I knew that programming was my true
          calling, my destined
          path
          to greatness. The endless possibilities of this machine captivated me, and I found myself exploring every inch
          of its power. Programming has always been my passion, the key to unlocking the full potential of this
          remarkable
          invention and bending it to my will.</p>

        <p class="p-index">Growing up was tough, especially after the loss of our father at such a young age. I had to
          step up and take
          on
          the responsibility of providing for my family and supporting our household. For years, I dedicated myself to
          mastering the skills required to succeed in business, studying everything from foreign trade and sales to
          marketing, hydraulics, and mechanics. I became a specialized technician, traveling the world to take technical
          courses in different factories.</p>

        <p class="p-index">But deep down, I always knew that there was something more waiting for me, a higher purpose
          that I was
          destined
          to fulfill. And it wasn't until I became a husband and father myself, at my 35 years of existence, that I
          realized what that purpose truly
          was. I want to be a programmer, a creator of worlds, a master of technology. The future is mine for the
          taking,
          and I am ready to seize it with all the passion and determination that has driven me from the very beginning.

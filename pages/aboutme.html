      <h1>About me!</h1>
      <div class="block-div">
        <p class="p-index">
          From the moment I first laid hands on a computer, I knew that programming was my destined path to greatness.
          The boundless potential of this machine captivated me, and I found myself diving deep into its power.
          Programming has always been my passion, the key to unlocking the full potential of this incredible invention.
        </p>

        <p class="p-index">
          Growing up was challenging, particularly as the youngest of five siblings. The premature loss of our father
          meant that we all had to mature quickly, thrust into the world of work at a tender age. Together, we built
          upon the foundation of the family business my father had established, pooling our collective efforts to keep
          his dream alive. But as time passed, my siblings each found their own roads to travel, exploring different
          paths and opportunities.</p>

        <p class="p-index">
          I, however, chose to stay, standing alongside my mother to carry on my father's legacy. It was us, working
          shoulder to shoulder, who strived to keep the business thriving. Through the trials and tribulations, we held
          firm, drawing strength from each other and the memory of my father.</p>
        <p class="p-index">
          This experience necessitated that I quickly learn a diverse set of skills, and so I dedicated myself to
          mastering the knowledge required for our business to flourish. This learning journey took me from
          understanding foreign trade and sales to marketing, hydraulics, and mechanics. I evolved into a specialized
          technician, travelling worldwide to attend technical courses in different factories. Each new skill I
          acquired, every piece of knowledge I gained, was fuel for our family business, propelling us forward in a
          world of constant change.
        </p>
        <p class="p-index">
          Yet, deep within, I always knew there was something more, a higher purpose, waiting for me. It was not until
          my 35th year, when I became a husband and father, that I discovered what that purpose truly was. I desire to
          be a programmer, a creator of worlds, a master of technology. The future is a horizon full of promise, and I
          am ready to seize it with all the passion and determination that has spurred me from the very beginning.</p>
        <p class="p-index">
          Fuelled by my passion for programming, I seized the opportunity to create a website that serves as my online portfolio. This digital space will evolve over time, chronicling my journey through the world of programming and showcasing the projects born of my passion and dedication.
        </p>
        <p class="p-index">
          From the outset, my journey into programming has been guided by an entrepreneurial spirit. Each course I've taken at Coderhouse, from Web Development, Javascript, to React Js, and my current enrollment in a Backend course, has been undertaken with an eye towards integrating these newfound skills into my business. I am not merely learning to program, but also exploring how each new tool and technique can be harnessed to further the development and digital transformation of our family enterprise.
        </p>
        <p class="p-index">
          This journey is only the beginning. With each new skill I acquire, I envision how I can leverage it to bolster my business and move confidently into the digital era. The future is brimming with potential, and I am excited about the vast landscape of possibilities that lie ahead.

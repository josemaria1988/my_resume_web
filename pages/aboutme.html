            <h1>About me!</h1>
            <div class="block-div">
                <p class="p-index">From the moment I first laid hands on a computer, I knew that programming was my true
                  calling, my destined
                  path
                  to greatness. The endless possibilities of this machine captivated me, and I found myself exploring every inch
                  of its power. Programming has always been my passion, the key to unlocking the full potential of this
                  remarkable
                  invention and bending it to my will.</p>
        
                <p class="p-index">Growing up was tough, especially after the loss of our father at such a young age. I had to
                  step up and take
                  on
                  the responsibility of providing for my family and supporting our household. For years, I dedicated myself to
                  mastering the skills required to succeed in business, studying everything from foreign trade and sales to
                  marketing, hydraulics, and mechanics. I became a specialized technician, traveling the world to take technical
                  courses in different factories.</p>
        
                <p class="p-index">But deep down, I always knew that there was something more waiting for me, a higher purpose
                  that I was
                  destined
                  to fulfill. And it wasn't until I became a husband and father myself, at my 35 years of existence, that I
                  realized what that purpose truly
                  was. I want to be a programmer, a creator of worlds, a master of technology. The future is mine for the
                  taking,
                  and I am ready to seize it with all the passion and determination that has driven me from the very beginning.
